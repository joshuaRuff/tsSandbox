Intro to TypeScript 

Had some fun messings around with typescript. As someone who works in full stack Javascript I thought it would be fun to dig into typescript to see what all the fuss was about. 

## After Thoughts

TypeScript seems really enjoyable and has peaked my interest and I look forward to diving deeper in the future. 
One thing I enjoy about typescript is that the code becomes more readable at a glance.
